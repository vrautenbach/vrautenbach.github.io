If the needs of a community are not met, they may feel unhappy and negative towards government organisations. Such feelings may motivate a society towards criminal tendencies. If government organisations can measure how fortunate a community is in terms of goods and services delivered to them they can manage and apply their financial resources to benefit the community.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to develop a methodology for measuring how fortunate a community is in terms of what they perceive as important against what they receive from government. The perceptions of what respondents consider important were determined based on a list of predefined goods and services. The best methodology to calculate a fortunate index (FI) was identified and evaluated using various statistical methods. The FI for the Census 2001 data was then compared with that of the Census 2011 data to determine if government had improved on their service delivery.  This research focuses on the methodology of developing a FI, and thus only a limited sample size was used to establish what people perceive as being fortunate. To our knowledge a similar methodology has not been developed for South Africa.  The FI proposes a new innovative way to determine if government provides the needs of a community.", "Vol": "Volume 4, No 3", "Year": 2015, "Link": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/273/178", "Comment": null, "ObjectId": 1 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.1122679, -26.2707593 ] } },

Currently, organizations use GIS data, especially spatial address data, to locate their customers and to deliver products and services to their doorsteps. In South Africa, the spatial address data are found in separate address databases, which are maintained by different organizations, with minimal or no cooperation among them. Contrary to research evidence pointing to the benefits of organizations sharing spatial data, most organizations still show inability and reluctance to participate in spatial data sharing initiatives; thus perpetuating the costly duplication of efforts in data handling and storage. The authors used a case study approach to assess the issues that motivate or obstruct GIS data sharing among three address organizations in South Africa. This paper presents the results of the three cases, and their implications on the interorganizational GIS data sharing initiatives as they occur in spatial data infrastructures (SDIs), particularly the South African SDI.

The mismatch between standard spatial metadata content and the search terms that Web users employ when looking for spatial data, presents a further barrier to spatial data discovery. The need arises for creating and sharing spatial metadata that is discoverable by general purpose web search engines and users alike. Using folksonomies and semantic annotations appears as an option to eliminate the mismatch and to publish the metadata for discovery on the Web. Based on an analysis of search query terms employed when searching for spatial data on the Web, a taxonomy of search terms is constructed.

Many of the migrants have settled in informal settlements because they cannot afford to rent or buy decent housing. Many of these settlements are however located on marginal and often poorly drained land. Consequently, most of these settlements are prone to flooding after prolonged rainfall. Current flood risk management techniques implemented by the authorities of the Cape Town City Council (CTCC) are not designed to support informal settlements. In fact, owing to a lack of information about the levels of flood risk within the individual settlements, either the CTCC has often been uninvolved or it has implemented inappropriate remedies within such settlements. This study sought to investigate a methodology that the CTCC could use to improve flood risk assessment. Using a case study of an informal settlement in Cape Town, this study proposed a methodology of integration of  community-based information into a Geographic Information System (GIS) that can be used by the CTCC for risk assessment. In addition, this  research demonstrated the use of a participatory multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) for risk assessment. A questionnaire was used to collect  community-based information. The shack outlines of the informal  settlement were digitized using CTCC aerial imagery. The questionnaires were captured using spreadsheets and linked to the corresponding shacks in the GIS.

Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) allows the easy integration of such additional features into the classification process. This paper compares the performance of three supervised classifiers in a GEOBIA environment as an increasing number of object features are included as classification input.

Image classification products were generated using spectral analysis of seasonal profiles, various resolution image inputs, spectral indices and ancillary data. Classification approaches varied by scene and spatial resolution as well as application of the data. Coarse resolution imagery and field data were used to create a probability map estimating the area vulnerable to Prosopis invasion using relationships between actual Prosopis occurrence, spectral response, soils and terrain unit. Multi-temporal Landsat images and a 500m x 500m point grid enabled vector analysis and statistical data to quantify the change in distribution and density as well as the spatial dynamics of Prosopis since 1974. Fragmentation and change of natural vegetation was quantified using a combined cover density class, calculating patch density per unit (ha) for each biome.

There is also the South African National Space Agency Act of 2008, which authorises the South African National Space Agency (SANSA) to acquire and utilise satellite remote sensing data.\n\nIt is of great concern that these various pieces of legislation confer authority on various entities to acquire, integrate, enhance and disseminate earth observation data.

Maps showing groundwater vulnerability assist with the identification of areas more susceptible to contamination than others. They are useful in planning, policy formulation and decision-making for groundwater management and protection. Overlaying these maps with maps showing the location of contamination sources and land use enables the creation of risk maps.\n\n\nThere are various methods for assessing groundwater vulnerability and from these the DRASTIC approach has been highlight in various studies as the most appropriate. This is mainly due to the fact that it is suitable for regional applications and the required input data are readily available. The DRASTIC index can be modified to incorporate anthropogenic influences on groundwater contamination and the modified form is called the DRASTIC Specific Vulnerability Index (DSVI). This paper discusses the creation of a groundwater vulnerability map for South Africa using the DSVI approach. The data used include the depth to groundwater, recharge, aquifer types, soil types, topography, the vadose zone, hydraulic conductivity and land use.

The CoJLIS was established to support integration of property data within various departments of the city. The current CoJLIS is designed for core land information only. There is a need for a comprehensive data model for all property information to support data management. The current CoJLIS upgrade coincides with the development of the LADM by ISO/TC 211, Geographic information/Geomatics. The LADM was published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) late in 2012 as an International Standard for modelling basic land administration (LA) information. The LADM aims to provide a common vocabulary within the LA domain. This research examined the core data model of CoJLIS against the corresponding LADM basic classes. The LADM presents an opportunity to adopt an ISO conformant model in the CoJLIS, thus leveraging the benefits associated with the LADM. We show that the LADM can be used to describe land administration information at a municipality in South Africa, but that there are semantic differences, similarities and mismatches of classes and attributes between the LADM and the CoJLIS. The current disconnect between different systems, each managing a different part of the land administration information at the CoJ, is a cause for concern. The research was restricted to the City of Johannesburg. The results improve the understanding of land administration at municipal level in South Africa, but more empirical explorations are necessary to examine the applicability of the LADM within different contexts, more especially in cadastre-less areas (e.g. informal settlements and rural areas).", "Vol": "Volume 2 no 3", "Year": 2013, "Link": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/98", "Comment": null, "ObjectId": 24 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.0473051, -26.2041028 ] } },

To overcome these constraints high resolution aerial imagery of 0.5m spatial resolution and a soft classifier, fuzzy classification, were employed to identify bracken fern infestations. This study compared imagery captured in winter and spring to determine which season was better suited for the image classification of bracken fern. The winter and spring classified images produced overall accuracies of 81.4% and 94.4% with Kappa coefficients of 0.63 and 0.89 respectively.

An aspect of this is land value and the degree of simplicity/complexity in land value is found to be well-aligned with the land rights types in the former continuum model. This is adopted as a suitable substitute for the former measure of informality/formality when locating land rights types on the horizontal axis. Legitimacy, legality and complexity are identified as indicators of land tenure security. These lead to the triple vertical indices of land tenure security in the new model. The range of land rights options in use, their associated land tenure, as well as mobility of people and flexibility of land parcels between land rights types, can be modelled.", "Vol": "Volume 3, No 1", "Year": 2014, "Link": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/109/86", "Comment": null, "ObjectId": 35 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 22.937506, -30.559482 ] } },

Despite large government spending on education, research has shown that the South African schooling system is struggling to convert resources to student performances and failing to promote social equity. The poor performance by South African students prompts further investigation into the factors contributing to educational outputs.  The focus of this case study in Cape Town is twofold, firstly to determine if there are any spatial patterns among the matric pass rates of secondary schools and secondly to determine if there are any relationships between the matric pass rate of the school and the socio-economic attributes of the school feeder areas.  Key findings of this research suggest that Cape Town schools are clustered in terms of school performance with high performing schools grouped together and many low performing schools also clustered together. There were a few exceptions where within a cluster of low performing schools there was one high performing school and vice versa.  Outcomes of the research into spatially varying relationships point to selected socio-economic factors of the community, particularly parent and household characteristics, influencing the learner’s school performance.

Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) facilitate access, sharing and dissemination of spatial data necessary for complex decision-making processes of the future. Thus, conducting SDI assessment is essential to guide its development, to monitor and improve its quality and to provide evidence of accountability for all stakeholders. Knowledge of the development status of SDI of a country is crucial to increase the accountability and development of spatial data information. In Kenya, there are many organisations both public and private that are involved in spatial data production, use and dissemination to meet needs of the geo-information community. However the developmental status of Kenya National Spatial Data Infrastructure (KNSDI) is unknown. This paper aims at evaluating the development of SDI-initiative in Kenya with an aim of contributing to the enhancement of SDI development to realise its fundamental objectives. Then explore the level to which Kenya is prepared to attain an operational SDI, expose best practices, identify main problems, and review the way forward. Three assessment approaches of multi-view assessment framework were adopted. They are; SDI-Readiness index, Modified state of play and Organisational aspects. Data collection was by interview and questionnaire surveys from 13 KNSDI stakeholders sampled purposely from the following categories; academia, NGOs, public and private sector, civil society, international organisations and government. Document analysis and internet search supplemented data collection. The results indicate that development of KNSDI and implementation in Kenya is ad hoc and fragmented. This paper identified funding sustainability, awareness for SDI and all-inclusiveness communication as major aspects of Kenya NSDI that need to be addressed. The paper suggests that Kenya NSDI secretariat should work towards resolving the identified obstacles by: i).Sustained funding through increased budgetary allocation from the central government and other alternative sources of funding like open source services and cost recovery on geo-information products. ii).

This paper examines the quantification of woody vegetation in the field and on historical high spatial resolution imagery, using the southern granites research supersite in the Kruger National Park (KNP) as test case. The recently established research supersites represent the key characteristics of the vegetation zones in the KNP. Field quantification of woody cover was undertaken in June and September 2013 by employing a detailed procedure that quantified the area covered by individual woody (tree, shrub) canopies at twelve one hectare sample plots. The area covered by the woody individuals at the respective plots was then totalled in order to yield the fraction (%) of cover per hectare.  The woody cover data were then related to test recent historical imagery in order to assess woody cover estimation procedures on historical imagery. Digital high spatial resolution aerial photographs (dated 2010) and dry period (spring/autumn) SPOT multispectral images (September 2001, April 2012) were used; the dry period dates selected so as to eliminate herbaceous vegetation from the analysis. For the newest (2012) image, sub-pixel classification correctly assigned woody cover at the field sample plots to their 2013 field-derived cover fractions.

In South Africa, snow is commonly limited to the country’s higher grounds and is considered one of the most destructive natural hazards. As a result, mapping of snow cover is an important process in catchment management and hazard mitigation. However, generating snow maps using survey techniques is often expensive, tedious and time consuming. Within the South African context, field surveys are therefore not ideal for the often highly dynamic snow covers.  As an alternative, thematic cover–types based on remotely sensed data-sets are becoming popular. In this study we hypothesise that the reduced dimensionality using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) in concert Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is valuable for improving the accuracy of snow cover maps. Using the recently launched 11 spectral band Landsat 8 dataset, we propose a new technique that combines the principal component imager generated using PCA with commonly used NDSI, referred to as Normalised Difference Principal Component Snow Index (NDPCSI) to improve snow mapping accuracy. Results show that both NDPCSI and NDSI with high classification accuracies of 84.9% and 76.8% respectively, were effective in mapping snow.  Results from the study also indicate that NDSI was sensitive to water bodies found on lower grounds within the study area while the PCA was able to de-correlate snow from water bodies and shadows. Although the NDSI and NDPCSI produced comparable results, the NDPCSI was capable of mapping snow from other related land covers with better accuracy. The superiority of the NDPCSI can particularly be attributed to the ability of principal component analysis to de-correlate snow from water bodies and shadows. The accuracy of both techniques was evaluated using a higher spatial resolution Landsat 8 panchromatic band and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data acquired on the same day. The findings suggest that NDPCSI is a viable alternative in mapping snow especially in heterogeneous landscape that includes water bodies.", "Vol": "Volume 3, No 2", "Year": 2014, "Link": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/193/119", "Comment": null, "ObjectId": 43 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 19.2593642, -33.0495642 ] } },

The eight band WV2 image was atmospherically corrected and spectrally resized  as the SPOT-5 wavebands, additional bands and all bands. The classification accuracy was compared to results from the SPOT-5 image. Results showed that classification based on WV-2s additional bands had superior classification accuracy than the rest of the categories. Furthermore, classification based on all the WV-2s bands and the traditional bands perfomed better than the SPOT-5 image in delineating areas covered by the fern.

Monwabisi is located near the City of Cape Town and is situated along the northern coastline of False Bay. The erosion that has occurred has raised concern as it is damaging local infrastructure. The coastline retreat to the east of Monwabisi was investigated through analysis of aerial photographs and wave data to establish whether there is a relationship between dynamic wave action that this bay is subjected to, and the observed erosion within the study area.

This study used remote sensing as a tool to provide some information on the inter-relationship between vegetated classes and bare areas.

A density slicing approach was adopted to classify the region into four vegetation structure classes of predominant land cover types. Post classification change detection data has provided an understanding of the relative susceptibility of the different vegetated classes to being degraded to bare areas.

This study explores the potential of multispectral remotely sensed dataset in determining the influence of rural/urban LULC gradient on urban thermal characteristics. A rectangular eleven band Landsat 8 image subset was delineated from the central business district to the rural periphery and classified into most dominant LULCs and a corresponding Landsat 8 thermal layer used to determine the LULCs thermal characteristics. Digitized point data was used to determine differences in land surface temperature (LST) over gradient's LULC types. Results showed that there was varied contribution of LULCs to the LST. As expected, the density of built up surfaces and LST decreased towards the city’s periphery while a decline in vegetation density from the periphery led to an increase in LST. These results provide valuable insights into the value of remotely sensed datasets in understanding the implication of intra-urban LULC gradient on LST characteristics.

The advent of new high resolution multispectral sensors with unique bands has provided an opportunity to map the spatial distribution of detailed LULC classes over a large fragmented area. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to map LULC classes using multispectral WorldView-2 (WV-2) data and SVM in a fragmented ecosystem; and (2) to compare the accuracy of three WV-2 spectral data sets in distinguishing amongst various LULC classes in a fragmented ecosystem. WV-2 image was spectrally resized to its four standard bands (SB: blue, green, red and near infrared-1) and four strategically located bands (AB: coastal blue, yellow, red edge and near infrared-2). WV-2 image (8bands: 8B) together with SB and AB subsets were used to classify LULC using support vector machines. Overall classification accuracies of 78.0% (total disagreement = 22.0%) for 8B, 51.0% (total disagreement = 49.0%) for SB, and 64.0% (total disagreement = 36.0%) for AB were achieved. There were significant differences between the performance of all WV-2 subset pair comparisons (8B versus SB, 8B versus AB and SB versus AB) as demonstrated by the results of McNemar’s test (Z score ≥1.96).

Natural landscapes such as vegetation and water bodies act as thermal sinks that absorb heat while impervious surfaces such as buildings and concrete pavements act as thermal sources that retain and emit heat. The thermal emission results in several negative effects such as temperature inversion, compromised human health, pollution, species loss, high energy consumption and climate change at a local, regional and global scales. Whereas studies on UHI are abound, there is paucity in literature on the influence of seasonal urban Land Use Land Cover (LULC) transformation on urban thermal characteristics. Specifically, the proportional seasonal variability and contribution of individual LULCs to urban heat is often poorly understood. Using the freely available Landsat 8 optical and thermal bands, this study examined the seasonal characteristics of the UHI phenomenon in relation to LULCs in the Pietermaritzburg city, South Africa. Results in this study revealed that UHIs exist in both winter and summer, but with more intensity in summer. The study also established that LULCs varied with seasons. Bare surfaces and dense vegetation had the most thermal influence during winter while dense vegetation and low density buildings had the most thermal influence during summer. These findings provide a better understanding of thermal distribution based on LULC seasonality changes, valuable for sustainable urban planning and climate change mitigation.

The results revealed that the spatiotemporal changes in PWV content are largely subjugated by the effects of latitude, topographical features, the seasons and the continental air masses. Our study shows that there is a very strong seasonal interplay among the GNSS PWV, relative humidity, rainfall and cloud estimates. In addition, GNSS PWV and total electron content (TEC) estimates show an opposite relationship; the semi-diurnal relationship between GNSS PWV and TEC is stronger than the seasonal relationship.

Through the likelihood analysis, the likelihood for change to occur (e.g. cultivated to grassland) and unlikelihood of change to occur (e.g. built-up to planted forest), resulted in 72.2% areas of potential realistic change. The change detection results, further depend on the quality, compatibility and accuracy of the input land cover datasets. The application of different ancillary data together with different modelling techniques for land cover classification also affect the true reflectance of land cover change detection.

The study also investigated the significance of past (lagged) groundwater and NDVI in estimating the current NDVI. Results showed that lagged groundwater depth and vegetation conditions influence the amount of current NDVI. It was also observed that first lags of groundwater depth and NDVI were significant predictors of NDVI in grassland. In addition, first and second lags of NDVI were consistently significant predictors of NDVI in shrubland.

These settlements are not planned and therefore lack conventional urban characteristics, such as street names and a regular grid or block structure, which are useful aids during wayfinding. As a result, it is difficult to navigate through such a settlement or to provide directions to a specific destination. The lack of street names also implies that directions provided by others play a more important role. In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative between-subjects study that assessed individuals’ wayfinding efficiency when using different types of directions in an informal settlement. Participants were divided into two groups of six participants each (3 males and 3 females). Two sets of directions were constructed for the same route, one based on left-right turn descriptors and landmarks, and the second based on cardinal directions and distances. The performance of participants was measured for each set of directions. Earlier studies reported that people preferred left-right directions but performed better when using cardinal directions. The results of our study show the opposite. We think that this is due to the lack of regular wayfinding aids in informal settlements, but further studies are required to confirm this. The results of our study are interesting for developers of navigational tools aimed at addressing the needs of people in informal settlements.", "Vol": "Volume 7, No 2", "Year": 2018, "Link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/sajg.v7i2.5", "Comment": null, "ObjectId": 117 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 22.937506, -30.559482 ] } },

Mechanistic crop models, for example, classically operate at a site-specific, point location, for which soil and climate must be described in great detail.  Future climate scenarios however, are obtained from various Global Climate Models (GCMs) at a very coarse resolution – typically gridded to 300 km or more.  In order to be useful at a local level they need to be downscaled to a spatial scale useful for local analysis.  Weather monitoring station locations in the province are irregularly distributed – much denser in the fruit and vine areas than in the extensive wheat areas.  The Western Cape Province is a highly diverse region with regard to geology, topography, climatic influences and the resulting agricultural systems and practices.  Future climate change therefore, is likely to have different impacts in different zones of the province where wheat is produced.  To address this heterogeneity, the province was divided into 21 distinct response zones for modelling purposes.  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) play a key role in addressing the spatial complexities - facilitating issues such as weighted average zonation, aggregation (or disaggregation) of spatial components, local parameterisation of crop models through interpolation, integration of ancillary data such as satellite imagery within the modelling framework and finally in the spatial analysis and display of modelled scenarios. This paper uses a recent climate impact study in the Western Cape to demonstrate the role of GIS in the assessment of expected climate change impacts on dryland wheat agriculture.", "Vol": "Volume 7, No 2", "Year": 2018, "Link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/sajg.v7i2.6", "Comment": null, "ObjectId": 118 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 21.8568586, -33.2277918 ] } },

The implementation of these models at a provincial scale is however very limited in South Africa. LULC change models are valuable if their structures are based on a deep knowledge of the system under investigation and if they produce credible results. This study therefore investigates the suitability of LULC change models in simulating LULC changes at a provincial scale in a South African context. The Dyna-CLUE model was implemented using the following as inputs: spatial policies and restrictions; land-use type conversions; land use requirements (demands) and location characteristics. The model produced probability maps and simulation maps for the years between 1990 and 2014. Validation of the simulated maps was conducted using both visual and statistical analysis and the results indicated that the simulated maps were in good agreement with the validation map. This study contributes to the implementation of LULC change models at a provincial scale in a South African context.

In Africa, it is regarded as one of the most popular food crops. Recently however, significant losses due to Phaeosphaeria leaf spot (PLS) infestation have been reported. Therefore, techniques for early detection of PLS infestation are valuable for mitigating maize yield losses. Recently, remotely sensed datasets have become valuable in crop assessment.  In this study, we compared the performance of commonly used higher spatial resolution sensors (WorldView, Quickbird, Sentinel series 2, RapidEye and SPOT 6) resampled to field hyperspectral remotely sensed data in detecting early PLS infestation. Canopy training spectra were collected on leaves with signs of early infestation and healthy leaves spectral characteristics used for comparison. Training data was collected in 2013 growing season while test data was collected under similar conditions in 2014.  The Random Forest algorithm was used to establish the Kappa and overall, user and producer's accuracies. Results showed that the RapidEye sensor with an 86.96% and Kappa value of 0.76 performed better than the rest of the sensors while the Red, Yellow and Red-Edge bands were most useful for detecting early PLS infestation. The value of the RapidEye sensor in detecting early PLS infestation can be attributed to the optimally centred Red Red-Edge bands sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content, a consequent of PLS infestation on maize leaves.

Global Moran’s I test was performed on the standard residuals to statistically test for their randomness. The analysis yielded local parameter estimates which were mapped to reveal the spatial variation of the relationships. There was strong influence of facility allocation gap in the North West diminishing towards South East, Strong negative influence of the staffing gap in the South West diminishing eastwards, and High influence of Stock-Out days in the South compared to the South West.
