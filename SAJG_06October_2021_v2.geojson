Currently, organizations use GIS data, especially spatial address data, to locate their customers and to deliver products and services to their doorsteps. In South Africa, the spatial address data are found in separate address databases, which are maintained by different organizations, with minimal or no cooperation among them. Contrary to research evidence pointing to the benefits of organizations sharing spatial data, most organizations still show inability and reluctance to participate in spatial data sharing initiatives; thus perpetuating the costly duplication of efforts in data handling and storage. The authors used a case study approach to assess the issues that motivate or obstruct GIS data sharing among three address organizations in South Africa. This paper presents the results of the three cases, and their implications on the interorganizational GIS data sharing initiatives as they occur in spatial data infrastructures (SDIs), particularly the South African SDI. It is our hope that these findings pertaining to motivators or barriers for interorganizational GIS data sharing (as it was applied to the three cases) will provide valuable lessons to guide organizations to develop and implement successful data sharing initiatives.", "Vol": "Volume 1, no 1", "Year": 2012, "Link to Journal": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/19", "Comment": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 22.937506, -30.559482 ] } },

Flood risk management. Multi-criteria Evaluation. GIS. Participation. Risk weights.", "Abstract": "Rural-urban migrations have contributed to the steady increase in the population of Cape Town. Many of the migrants have settled in informal settlements because they cannot afford to rent or buy decent housing. Many of these settlements are however located on marginal and often poorly drained land. Consequently, most of these settlements are prone to flooding after prolonged rainfall. Current flood risk management techniques implemented by the authorities of the Cape Town City Council (CTCC) are not designed to support informal settlements. In fact, owing to a lack of information about the levels of flood risk within the individual settlements, either the CTCC has often been uninvolved or it has implemented inappropriate remedies within such settlements. This study sought to investigate a methodology that the CTCC could use to improve flood risk assessment. Using a case study of an informal settlement in Cape Town, this study proposed a methodology of integration of  community-based information into a Geographic Information System (GIS) that can be used by the CTCC for risk assessment. In addition, this  research demonstrated the use of a participatory multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) for risk assessment. A questionnaire was used to collect  community-based information. The shack outlines of the informal  settlement were digitized using CTCC aerial imagery. The questionnaires were captured using spreadsheets and linked to the corresponding shacks in the GIS.

Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) allows the easy integration of such additional features into the classification process. This paper compares the performance of three supervised classifiers in a GEOBIA environment as an increasing number of object features are included as classification input. Classification tree analysis (CTA) was employed for feature selection and importance ranking. Object features were considered in the order of their obtained rank.

Image classification products were generated using spectral analysis of seasonal profiles, various resolution image inputs, spectral indices and ancillary data. Classification approaches varied by scene and spatial resolution as well as application of the data. Coarse resolution imagery and field data were used to create a probability map estimating the area vulnerable to Prosopis invasion using relationships between actual Prosopis occurrence, spectral response, soils and terrain unit. Multi-temporal Landsat images and a 500m x 500m point grid enabled vector analysis and statistical data to quantify the change in distribution and density as well as the spatial dynamics of Prosopis since 1974.

Three cartographic related aspects were the focus of this review:  (1) technology, (2) map related services, and (3) legislation.\n\nThe findings identify cartographic services and also highlight differences, especially between the libraries in South Africa and those in international countries. The results indicate that while South African libraries are known to have map collections, online services, in the form of digital maps and geospatial data, are not readily accessible. Furthermore, the researcher suggests that there is a need for research that focuses on Geographic Information Librarianship and the GIS Librarian in SA.", "Vol": "Volume 2, no 2", "Year": 2013, "Link to Journal": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/77", "Comment": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 22.937506, -30.559482 ] } },

The existing vegetation types of South Africa data set were superimposed on the newly classified remnants of natural vegetation to model changes in biodiversity. It was found that the area occupied by natural vegetation increased by more than 14%, suggesting an increase in biodiversity from 1986/7 to 2007. Considerable variation between vegetation types was, however, recorded.  The land cover mapping, change analysis and biodiversity modelling methods employed by this study show that land-cover change analysis provides an ideal platform from which to initiate more intensive analyses of biodiversity change and conservation.

This paper explores ways to integrate unemployment data from 1991 to 2007 to obtain a spatially more detailed understanding of the phenomenon.  Creating such a temporal GIS is challenging because of the changing administrative boundaries and this phenomenon is part of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP).  The MAUP was overcome by using proportional aggregation to the 2005 municipal boundaries.  The unemployment data were analysed spatially through mapping standard deviation intervals and spatial autocorrelation.  Unemployment showed a spatial pattern over time in South Africa and municipalities with high unemployment figures over time were spatially concentrated.  Furthermore, it is recommended that census data should be released at a small area level to allow more accurate comparison of socio-economic data over time.", "Vol": "Volume 2 no 3", "Year": 2013, "Link to Journal": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/100", "Comment": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 22.937506, -30.559482 ] } },

The CoJLIS was established to support integration of property data within various departments of the city. The current CoJLIS is designed for core land information only. There is a need for a comprehensive data model for all property information to support data management. The current CoJLIS upgrade coincides with the development of the LADM by ISO/TC 211, Geographic information/Geomatics. The LADM was published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) late in 2012 as an International Standard for modelling basic land administration (LA) information. The LADM aims to provide a common vocabulary within the LA domain. This research examined the core data model of CoJLIS against the corresponding LADM basic classes. The LADM presents an opportunity to adopt an ISO conformant model in the CoJLIS, thus leveraging the benefits associated with the LADM. We show that the LADM can be used to describe land administration information at a municipality in South Africa, but that there are semantic differences, similarities and mismatches of classes and attributes between the LADM and the CoJLIS. The current disconnect between different systems, each managing a different part of the land administration information at the CoJ, is a cause for concern. The research was restricted to the City of Johannesburg. The results improve the understanding of land administration at municipal level in South Africa, but more empirical explorations are necessary to examine the applicability of the LADM within different contexts, more especially in cadastre-less areas (e.g. informal settlements and rural areas).", "Vol": "Volume 2 no 3", "Year": 2013, "Link to Journal": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/98", "Comment": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 28.0473051, -26.2041028 ] } },

About 20% of land in Ghana was acquired through a legal process of compulsory acquisition by the government. This process extinguishes all proprietary and jurisdictional rights, titles, or other interests vested in the stool (traditional authority) or any other person. Among other things, compulsory acquisition aims to provide land for public purposes, to correct economic and social inefficiencies in the use of land and also to deliver on broader goals of social justice and equity in the land sector through the redistribution of land. Most compulsory acquisition laws make provision for prompt payment of adequate compensation for those who are dispossessed, but this has not always been the case resulting in disputes. This paper adopts a case study approach in Tema (Accra) and Aprade (Kumasi), Ghana, to investigate compulsory acquisition and to assess the consequences of this process on urban land delivery. The study seeks to understand why the affected communities have re-occupied land that was acquired from them through compulsory acquisition many years ago. The paper concludes that the general policy on compulsory acquisition is in need of review while the payment of compensation requires further detailed investigation.", "Vol": "Volume 2 no 4", "Year": 2013, "Link to Journal": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/111", "Comment": "Check location in article" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -0.1869644, 5.6037168 ] } },

Prior image classification research on bracken fern were constrained by low resolution satellite imagery and the inability of hard classifiers to account for mixed pixels.  Currently there are differing views on which season is best for mapping of bracken fern. To overcome these constraints high resolution aerial imagery of 0.5m spatial resolution and a soft classifier, fuzzy classification, were employed to identify bracken fern infestations. This study compared imagery captured in winter and spring to determine which season was better suited for the image classification of bracken fern. The winter and spring classified images produced overall accuracies of 81.4% and 94.4% with Kappa coefficients of 0.63 and 0.89 respectively.

In developing the argument for the proposed model, the theoretical assumptions of the former model are challenged and an understanding of land rights and tenure elements is explored. The evolutionary approach is rejected in order to accommodate diversity and reflect the coexistence of multiple forms of land rights. In order to inform the development of a new model, a systems understanding is used to identify five primary elements of land rights and land tenure. These are expanded in a tabular form in the Appendix to the paper. An aspect of this is land value and the degree of simplicity/complexity in land value is found to be well-aligned with the land rights types in the former continuum model. This is adopted as a suitable substitute for the former measure of informality/formality when locating land rights types on the horizontal axis.

Geographic Information Systems require a sizeable investment in terms of financial, information and communication technology (ICT) and human resources while they are largely financed by public funds. This adoption is partly influenced by the promises of GIS that has been widely discussed in GIS literature. Geographic information systems have potential in aiding decision making and in public policy formulation and implementation. From a public sector point of view, the society should benefit from the implementation and adoption of GIS. In order to determine whether systems are meeting their intended objectives, it is of importance to develop a mechanism for measuring the success derived from implementing such systems. Evaluation is a means to justify these information systems that are being adopted. However, evaluation methodologies for public sector GIS are largely lacking. Most evaluation procedures available in literature such as returns on investment are based on the commercial sector where operations are profit driven. The public sector presents a different dimension as focus in provision of public goods with an intent to achieve societal good. This study develops an evaluation model for Geographical Information Systems within the public sector. The study is based on field data collected in various public sector organisations in Uganda.

Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) facilitate access, sharing and dissemination of spatial data necessary for complex decision-making processes of the future. Thus, conducting SDI assessment is essential to guide its development, to monitor and improve its quality and to provide evidence of accountability for all stakeholders. Knowledge of the development status of SDI of a country is crucial to increase the accountability and development of spatial data information. In Kenya, there are many organisations both public and private that are involved in spatial data production, use and dissemination to meet needs of the geo-information community. However the developmental status of Kenya National Spatial Data Infrastructure (KNSDI) is unknown. This paper aims at evaluating the development of SDI-initiative in Kenya with an aim of contributing to the enhancement of SDI development to realise its fundamental objectives. Then explore the level to which Kenya is prepared to attain an operational SDI, expose best practices, identify main problems, and review the way forward. Three assessment approaches of multi-view assessment framework were adopted. They are; SDI-Readiness index, Modified state of play and Organisational aspects. Data collection was by interview and questionnaire surveys from 13 KNSDI stakeholders sampled purposely from the following categories; academia, NGOs, public and private sector, civil society, international organisations and government. Document analysis and internet search supplemented data collection. The results indicate that development of KNSDI and implementation in Kenya is ad hoc and fragmented. This paper identified funding sustainability, awareness for SDI and all-inclusiveness communication as major aspects of Kenya NSDI that need to be addressed. The paper suggests that Kenya NSDI secretariat should work towards resolving the identified obstacles by: i).Sustained funding through increased budgetary allocation from the central government and other alternative sources of funding like open source services and cost recovery on geo-information products. ii).

This paper examines the quantification of woody vegetation in the field and on historical high spatial resolution imagery, using the southern granites research supersite in the Kruger National Park (KNP) as test case. The recently established research supersites represent the key characteristics of the vegetation zones in the KNP. Field quantification of woody cover was undertaken in June and September 2013 by employing a detailed procedure that quantified the area covered by individual woody (tree, shrub) canopies at twelve one hectare sample plots. The area covered by the woody individuals at the respective plots was then totalled in order to yield the fraction (%) of cover per hectare.  The woody cover data were then related to test recent historical imagery in order to assess woody cover estimation procedures on historical imagery. Digital high spatial resolution aerial photographs (dated 2010) and dry period (spring/autumn) SPOT multispectral images (September 2001, April 2012) were used; the dry period dates selected so as to eliminate herbaceous vegetation from the analysis. For the newest (2012) image, sub-pixel classification correctly assigned woody cover at the field sample plots to their 2013 field-derived cover fractions.

In South Africa, snow is commonly limited to the country’s higher grounds and is considered one of the most destructive natural hazards. As a result, mapping of snow cover is an important process in catchment management and hazard mitigation. However, generating snow maps using survey techniques is often expensive, tedious and time consuming. Within the South African context, field surveys are therefore not ideal for the often highly dynamic snow covers.  As an alternative, thematic cover–types based on remotely sensed data-sets are becoming popular. In this study we hypothesise that the reduced dimensionality using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) in concert Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is valuable for improving the accuracy of snow cover maps. Using the recently launched 11 spectral band Landsat 8 dataset, we propose a new technique that combines the principal component imager generated using PCA with commonly used NDSI, referred to as Normalised Difference Principal Component Snow Index (NDPCSI) to improve snow mapping accuracy. Results show that both NDPCSI and NDSI with high classification accuracies of 84.9% and 76.8% respectively, were effective in mapping snow.  Results from the study also indicate that NDSI was sensitive to water bodies found on lower grounds within the study area while the PCA was able to de-correlate snow from water bodies and shadows. Although the NDSI and NDPCSI produced comparable results, the NDPCSI was capable of mapping snow from other related land covers with better accuracy. The superiority of the NDPCSI can particularly be attributed to the ability of principal component analysis to de-correlate snow from water bodies and shadows. The accuracy of both techniques was evaluated using a higher spatial resolution Landsat 8 panchromatic band and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data acquired on the same day. The findings suggest that NDPCSI is a viable alternative in mapping snow especially in heterogeneous landscape that includes water bodies.", "Vol": "Volume 3, No 2", "Year": 2014, "Link to Journal": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/193/119", "Comment": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 19.2593642, -33.0495642 ] } },

The occurrence of landslides and other related disasters in Uganda requires a shift from the current disaster management approach where interventions come into play following the disaster, towards a better approach where mitigation measures are planned before the disaster. In Uganda, studies that utilize spatial technologies to develop tools to support landslide disaster prediction have been limited by the problem of spatial data suitability and availability. This paper explores the suitability of the available spatial datasets as inputs into GIS-based landslide risk assessment in Uganda.  The datasets used in this study included digital elevation model, soils, precipitation, vegetation cover and population. The relative importance of datasets was established by a combination of literature review, expert opinion and pair wise comparison technique. Through GIS tools, a prediction map was generated that showed risk levels of various areas in Uganda. The results from GIS analysis showed that the areas of highest risk included mountain slopes associated with high rainfall and clayey soils. The predicted high risk areas coincided with areas where landslides have recently occurred. On the basis of this, it was concluded that the current spatial datasets in Uganda, combined with data in the public domain could still be useful in providing reasonable predictions about landslides at a national level.

In the past, Statistics South Africa disseminated data at the same geographic level created for data collection.

A high percentage of the Earth’s water supply is stored underground which can be extracted either through pumping or using artesian pressure.  This paper describes the application of GNSS, InSAR and In-Situ Micro Gravity measurements for the monitoring of an artesian wellfield in the Oudtshoorn District in the Western Cape province of South Africa. GNSS receivers were run continuously for a period of 133 days between March and August 2014 to detect possible surface subsidence during pumping and artesian free flow extraction of water in the wellfield. Two InSAR scenes were processed, one during the peak period of water extraction from the wellfield and the other approximately 4 months after all boreholes were closed and pumps switched off. A micro-gravity campaign was conducted over two days in the wellfield with the gravity meter co-located at one borehole which was opened on the second day of the campaign. The results from the GNSS monitoring showed a subsidence of approximately 15 to 20 mm at the peak of the free flow and pump while those from the InSAR and micro-gravity measurements were largely inconclusive.

Besides internal government performance measures, citizen satisfaction surveys are useful in providing citizen-based measurement of satisfaction with service delivery and the performance of government. With 27 490 respondents across Gauteng, the 2013 Gauteng City-Region Observatory (GCRO) Quality of Life (QoL) survey provides an interesting snap shot of attitudes towards government. A spatial statistical approach is applied to the 2013 QoL survey data to analyse patterns of dissatisfaction with the performance of local government. The analysis reveals spatial clustering in the level of dissatisfaction with the performance of local government. It also reveals percentage of respondents dissatisfied with dwelling, mean sense of safety index, and percentage agree the country is going in the wrong direction, as significant predictors of the level of local dissatisfaction. Other predictors include the percentage of respondents that think lack of maintenance is the biggest problem facing the community, and percentage agree that politics is waste of time.

Whereas the existence of UHI is common knowledge, the implication of urban land use land cover (LULC) gradient on intra-urban thermal characteristics is often poorly understood. A recent proliferation of remotely sensed datasets offer great potential in understanding the relationship between urban LULCs and their respective thermal characteristics, a critical basis for urban environmental management and designing climate change mitigation measures. This study explores the potential of multispectral remotely sensed dataset in determining the influence of rural/urban LULC gradient on urban thermal characteristics. A rectangular eleven band Landsat 8 image subset was delineated from the central business district to the rural periphery and classified into most dominant LULCs and a corresponding Landsat 8 thermal layer used to determine the LULCs thermal characteristics. Digitized point data was used to determine differences in land surface temperature (LST) over gradient's LULC types. Results showed that there was varied contribution of LULCs to the LST. As expected, the density of built up surfaces and LST decreased towards the city’s periphery while a decline in vegetation density from the periphery led to an increase in LST.

The advent of new high resolution multispectral sensors with unique bands has provided an opportunity to map the spatial distribution of detailed LULC classes over a large fragmented area. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to map LULC classes using multispectral WorldView-2 (WV-2) data and SVM in a fragmented ecosystem; and (2) to compare the accuracy of three WV-2 spectral data sets in distinguishing amongst various LULC classes in a fragmented ecosystem. WV-2 image was spectrally resized to its four standard bands (SB: blue, green, red and near infrared-1) and four strategically located bands (AB: coastal blue, yellow, red edge and near infrared-2). WV-2 image (8bands: 8B) together with SB and AB subsets were used to classify LULC using support vector machines. Overall classification accuracies of 78.0% (total disagreement = 22.0%) for 8B, 51.0% (total disagreement = 49.0%) for SB, and 64.0% (total disagreement = 36.0%) for AB were achieved. There were significant differences between the performance of all WV-2 subset pair comparisons (8B versus SB, 8B versus AB and SB versus AB) as demonstrated by the results of McNemar’s test (Z score ≥1.96).

The cadastre is a component of the land administration system (LAS) that is crucial for managing land. It is thus of importance for a nation to have both a functional cadastral system for determining parcel boundaries and a functional cadastral information system, for managing the land parcels. The cadastral survey system and cadastre in Zimbabwe are largely manual with even the lodgement of completed surveys for examination and approval still analogue. This has an impact on the time it takes to complete a land transaction. Land can ideally drive the economy yet part of the value is lost due to lengthy land transaction procedures. The land administration system is supposed to consist of value adding processes in which several actors interact in a workflow which creates new or transfers parcels. This workflow is associated with transaction costs, part of which can be employed for maintenance of the cadastral information system. This article presents business processes for the land development process in Zimbabwe but focusing on City of Gweru (CoG) and City of Mutare (CoM) municipalities as the major organisations under study. Municipalities in Zimbabwe are governed by the Regional Town and Country Planning Act, so such a single process and workflow model can fit into the cadastral information system of all municipalities in Zimbabwe with insignificant changes. The broader scope of this study is towards the design of a conceptual schema for automating the land administration system and particularly, the cadastre component, for municipalities in Zimbabwe. This study presents the workflows for the current land development system with CoG and CoM as the current focal points. Information on current automation efforts or reforms by other major municipalities to include Bulawayo, Kadoma and Kariba is also presented. The overall theme of this paper is to discuss cadastral reform through automation of cadastral processes in municipalities.

The annual deforestation rates of the reserve increased from 3.5% in period 1 (1987 – 1999) to 5.1% in period 2 (1999 – 2011).

It is based on a combination of the Uganda Gravimetric Quasigeoid model (UGQ) 2014 and GNSS/levelling. UGQ2014 was derived from the Uganda Gravimetric Geoid model (UGG) 2014, which was computed from sparse terrestrial gravity data from the International Gravimetric Bureau, the 3 arc second Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model and the GOCE – only global geopotential model GO_CONS_GCF_2_TIM_R5.  The corrective surface was constructed based on 21 discrete GNSS/levelling points and then evaluated with 4 independent points. Three interpolation techniques were tested for the creation of the corrective surface with the Kriging method giving the lowest standard deviation and noise level suggesting that it is the best method for interpolation. In terms of absolute heights, the RMS of the fit between the known and computed normal-orthometric heights based on the new height datum is 11cm, which is about 5cm (31%) better than using UGQ2014 alone. For relative heights an average precision of 29 ppm is computed for all baselines tested. Both the absolute and relative tests show that the new height datum satisfies the precision and accuracy requirements of third order precise levelling.

Using the study area of Harare, Zimbabwe, the paper demonstrates ways that, amidst the paucity of data, geographic information system can be used to measure urban development’s congruence with spatial plans. To prepare for the analysis, the base map preparation process entailed a laborious digitisation of hardcopy material obtained from the authorities. This was followed by land-use surveys and land-use change investigations whose data were analysed in ESRI’s ArcGIS 9.3. The analysis compared urban development patterns in 2014 with the proposals of two applicable spatial plans, which were approved in 1990 and 2000 respectively.

Directional convolution filters were also applied to the ASTER data to extract structural lineaments that may be related to gold mineralization. In addition, Fry analysis of known gold occurrences in the GGB was conducted to determine the major distribution patterns along which gold mineralization have occurred. LSU and SID results show several pixels classified as alteration minerals corresponding to known gold occurrences. SID results also show minerals overlapping into the gneissic rock, which is a rare host of gold mineralization in the study area. On the other hand, LSU results show high abundances of calcite and biotite generally confined within the mafic-ultramafic greenstone rocks, which have been hypothesized as the source of gold-mineralized fluids in the GGB. In general, LSU show distinct broad regions classified as alteration minerals corresponding to known gold occurrences that have been previously reported to host these alteration minerals. Directional convolution filters enabled the extraction of predominately NE-SW oriented linear structures, including the major shear zone which is associated with gold mineralization in the GGB.

Natural landscapes such as vegetation and water bodies act as thermal sinks that absorb heat while impervious surfaces such as buildings and concrete pavements act as thermal sources that retain and emit heat. The thermal emission results in several negative effects such as temperature inversion, compromised human health, pollution, species loss, high energy consumption and climate change at a local, regional and global scales. Whereas studies on UHI are abound, there is paucity in literature on the influence of seasonal urban Land Use Land Cover (LULC) transformation on urban thermal characteristics. Specifically, the proportional seasonal variability and contribution of individual LULCs to urban heat is often poorly understood.

Results in this study revealed that UHIs exist in both winter and summer, but with more intensity in summer. The study also established that LULCs varied with seasons.

In this study, three commonly applied interpolation methods (nearest point, kriging and moving average) were examined in an assessment of the varying dispersion of selected physical and chemical parameters of stream-borne effluents from palm oil processing area in a growing commercial centre in Ife South local government area in Nigeria. Specific objectives were to examine selected physiochemical properties of a stream that receives palm oil effluent, and compare results of a kriging interpolation using derived variogram values with that which was based on the accepted parametric default in a popular geographical information system. The study also presents visualised results of interpolation of selected parameters based on ordinary kriging, moving average and nearest point interpolation. Analysis were achieved using PAST 3 and ILWIS GIS software. Result showed that although the stream is vulnerable to contamination by the palm oil processing activities around the area, it also receives contaminants from other non-source points that were not investigated in this study. It also indicated that the different point interpolation methods did not produce similar results. Whereas the values of conductivity were interpolated to vary as 120.1 – 219.5 µScm-1 with kriging interpolation, it varied as 105.6 – 220.0 µScm-1 and 135.0 – 173.9 µScm-1 , with nearest point and moving average interpolations, respectively.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms, the land cover maps were subjected to accuracy assessment to determine precision of the algorithms in accurately classifying the land cover types and level of confidence that can be attributed to the land cover maps. Most algorithms poorly performed in classifying spatially overlapping land cover types without abrupt boundaries. This indicates that the environmental conditions and distribution of land cover types can affect the performance of certain classification algorithms, and thus need to be considered prior to selection of algorithms.

However, the invasion of grasslands by alien plant species has emerged as one of the biggest threats to their sustainability, management and conservation. Timely, cost-effective and accurate determination of invasive alien plant spatial distribution is paramount for mitigating the adverse effects of alien plants on natural grasslands. Whereas literature on use of optical bands for invasive alien plants detection and mapping is abound, there is paucity in literature on the integration of Vegetation Indices (VIs) and optical reflectance bands in invasive species mapping. Specifically, there is need to test the efficacy of improved and freely available sensors like Sentinel-2 in understanding landscape invasion. Hence, this study sought to assess the efficacy of Sentinel-2’s optical bands and VIs for improving the mapping of American Bramble (Rubus cuneifolius) within a grassland biome. Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP) was used to identify the most influential reflectance bands and VIs, which were then fused at a feature level to determine Bramble spatial distribution. To determine the optimal season for Bramble mapping, seasonal classification accuracies were executed in Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm and accuracies for Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter seasons compared. Results show that although the highest overall accuracy was achieved using only optical bands, fused imagery increased overall classification accuracies during spring and autumn i.e. 70% to 73% and 63% to 65%, respectively. However, the fused imagery failed to improve on the benchmark of optical imagery during summer and winter. Findings from this study underline the efficacy of complementing VIs and optical bands in determining the distribution of invasive species within grasslands at specific seasons.

Photo jobs with a range of photo numbers (12-237 images) and area coverage (>33 000-~150 000ha) were included. Self-calibration with 44-parameters and fixing the model to the ground control network achieved the highest final planimetric accuracy (total root mean square error [RMSE] ranging from 18.6 – 25.7px [7.1 – 21.8m] at ground control points and 20.5 – 27.7px [7.8 – 23.5m] at checkpoints).

In this study, GNSS PWV daily estimates were grouped into monthly and seasonal averages; the variations in the monthly and seasonal estimates of GNSS PWV were characterized and correlated with different weather events that are regarded as good climate change indicators. The results revealed that the spatiotemporal changes in PWV content are largely subjugated by the effects of latitude, topographical features, the seasons and the continental air masses. Our study shows that there is a very strong seasonal interplay among the GNSS PWV, relative humidity, rainfall and cloud estimates. In addition, GNSS PWV and total electron content (TEC) estimates show an opposite relationship; the semi-diurnal relationship between GNSS PWV and TEC is stronger than the seasonal relationship. The seasonal relation among GNSS PWV, temperature and wind speed appears weak, while very strong interplay exists among the GNSS PWV, sun spot number and total solar radiation estimates. Our results confirm that GNSS PWV is a good pointer for weather forecasting/monitoring and fit for climate monitoring if available on a longer time scale.

Between 1987 and 2003, average temperature rise and change in surface water area was +1.54˚C and +962.71km2 respectively. Between 2003 and 2017, average temperature rise and change in surface water area was +3.69˚C and -25.17km2 respectively.

Due to the advantages of repetitive data acquisition, the synoptic view, together with the varied spatial resolution it provides, and its available historically achieved dataset, remote sensing earth observation has become the major preferred data source for various earth studies. This study assesses land cover change detection of the land cover products (2013_2014 and 2017_2018) derived from earth observation. There are vast number of change detection methodologies and techniques with some still emerging. This study embarked on post classification change detection methodology which entailed morphological and spectral filtering techniques. The 10 land cover classes that were assessed for change detection are: natural wooded land, shrubland, grassland, waterbodies, wetlands, barren lands, cultivated, built-up, planted forest together with mines and quarries. The change detection accuracy result was 74.97%. Through the likelihood analysis, the likelihood for change to occur (e.g. cultivated to grassland) and unlikelihood of change to occur (e.g. built-up to planted forest), resulted in 72.2% areas of potential realistic change. The change detection results, further depend on the quality, compatibility and accuracy of the input land cover datasets. The application of different ancillary data together with different modelling techniques for land cover classification also affect the true reflectance of land cover change detection.

Forest and forest products provide myriad of economic, financial and health importance. The threat to the rainforest compelled the establishment of forest reserves with the introduction of exotic tree species. The Oluwa forest is located between latitudes 6º 37’ and 7 º 20’ north and longitudes 4 º 27’ and 5º 05’ east in Ondo state, Nigeria. Species richness and abundance data are crucial for conservation priority setting, and long-term vegetation monitoring. Few studies have been carried out on the composition of Terminalia spp, diversity and richness in the institutional-based landuse. The aim of this work is to analyze the influence of topography on Terminalia species diversity for conservation purpose. Complete enumeration of the Natural forest was carried out to determine the varieties of Terminalia species in the study site. In all, two variety, Terminalia, superba and Terminalia ivorensis were identified. GPS coordinate their locations was overlaid on Elevation, Slope, Aspect and Hillshad. The area with low elevation, and low slope, high hillshade, and the west aspect showed maximum species abundance. The Shannon diversity index of Terminalia species was calculated and the result implies that the diversity/abundance is low in the study site. It was observed that the spatial distribution and relative abundance of these species was influenced by topographic factors. Despite the limited range of altitudinal variation (399 m), species richness increases with elevation. This work has provided evidence of variability in Terminalia species composition, richness and diversity across the topographic gradient. The information could be crucial for monitoring and providing conservative measure for management of species sustainability.

The project aims at filling the gap existing in the availability of high spatial resolution maps of the agricultural areas of Kenya. A high spatial resolution land cover map of Central-Eastern Africa including Kenya was compiled in the year 2000 in the framework of the Africover project using Landsat images acquired, mostly, in 1995. We investigated the use of phenological information in supporting the use of remotely sensed images for crop classification and monitoring based on Landsat 8 and, in the near future, Sentinel 2 imagery. Phenological information on crop condition was collected using time series of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) based on Landsat 8 images. Kenyan countryside is mainly characterized by a high number of fragmented small and medium size farmlands that dramatically increase the difficulty in classification; 30 m spatial resolution images are not enough for a proper classification of such areas. So, a pan-sharpening FIHS (Fast Intensity Hue Saturation) technique was implemented to increase image resolution from 30 m to 15 m. Ground test sites were selected, searching for agricultural vegetated areas from which phenological information was extracted. Therefore, the classification of agricultural areas is based on crop phenology, vegetation index behaviour retrieved from a time series of satellite images and on AEZ (Agro Ecological Zones) information made available by FAO (FAO, 1996) for the area of interest. This paper presents the results of the proposed classification procedure in comparison with land cover maps produced in the past years by other projects.

The resultant maize suitability map was overlaid with constraints map to ‘mask out’ all non-agricultural land. The final maize suitability map shows that 3.20% of the total land is highly suitable, 16.56% is suitable, 25.34% is moderately suitable, 32.33% is marginally suitable and 9.57% is not suitable for maize production in its current form. The maize suitability classification was validated by regression analyses using measured maize grain yield of 5 key maize varieties representing 5 different maturity groups. Grain yield was regressed against suitability index (SI) of each land class. There were significant positive correlations between maize grain yield and land suitability classes (R2 = 0.63 - 0.85).

Acquisition of in situ soil moisture data is time consuming, costly, and does not cover the scale required for basin analysis.

This, in turn, poses a problem in the absence of in situ soil moisture. The present study suggests a methodology for testing the validity of remotely-sensed soil moisture without in situ soil moisture. Hydrological models with a detailed soil moisture routine are calibrated and validated with measured stream flows. Simulated soil moisture data of the most behavioural solutions from the models are averaged, and then used as proxy measurements. This methodology was applied to the Yankin Basin (8,171 Km2), a tributary of the Niger River Basin.

Some t-distribution tests established that there were no statistical differences between the coordinates determined by the reorientation traverses and the corresponding traditional traverses coordinates at the 99% confidence level.

In conflict and post-conflict situations, the constellation of interests from displaced persons, witnesses, and people who currently occupy the land that displaced persons once owned are often difficult to unravel, and conventional land record data models are often restricted in the type and scope of data to handle these complex situations. One solution is a database design that can capture multiple, overlapping and layered tenure relationships in a changing environment that are too complex for the relational data model to handle. The Triple Store graph database development system and its ontology languages were used to design and develop the TTN prototype. The authors’ observations from the Gaza Strip, an ongoing conflict situation, and Somaliland, a post-conflict situation, were used as illustrative contexts. The test results show that graph database flexibly captured, described, and automatically revealed tenure patterns.

Frequencies, descriptive and inferential statistics which include Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, ChiSquare test and correlation methods were used to analyze the data. Results indicated that majority of public servants in the selected professions were computer literate and had interest in GIS/remote sensing techniques and technologies. They were aware of the benefits than the costs of GIS/remote sensing techniques and technologies. Lack of time, inadequate finances, and lack of permission from the place of work were the three top constraints in building their GIS/remote sensing knowledge.

Ground investigations may be complex because of dual ownership, whereas remote sensing techniques and GIS application enable a fast multi-temporal detection of changes in forest cover and offer a cost-effective option for inaccessible areas and their use to detect ecosystem service change. The overarching goal of this study was to use satellite measurements to study forest change and link it to ecosystem service benefit reduction (fresh water) in the study area using a representative sample of Landsat scenes, also testing whether the inclusion of ecosystem service benefits improves the classification. In this paper, an integrated approach of remotely derived indices was used together with post-classification comparison to detect forest cover and ecosystem service changes. Our contribution novelty is the ability to detect at multi-temporal scale private and central reserve forest cover decline along with ecosystem benefit reduction using remotely derived indices in the 20 year period (1986-2005). Change detection analysis showed that forest cover declined significantly in five sub-counties of Mpigi, than in Butambala by 5.99%, disturbed forest was 3%, farm land increased by 44%, grassland declined by 62.5% and light vegetation increased by63.6%.

The impacts of the cumulative interplay of these extreme weather and events vary continue to perturb governments causing a scramble into formation of mitigation policies. However, national scale composites of climate hotspots remain a bottle neck to this policy formation.  This paper therefore, modelled the spatially explicit extreme weather and climate events indicators into a Uganda-national extreme weather and climate events composite hotspot indicator model. The hotspot model was mapped into decomposable sub-indicators based on the Geon concept. A spatial indicator framework is developed through literature review and expert knowledge. The resulting indicators were weighted using PCA/factor analysis and then normalized. They were aggregated using MCDA tools in an OBIA environment. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to ascertain the influence and significance of the indicators in the resultant model. A cumulative climate change index model is hence analysed and mapped. The mapping provides spatially explicit information regarding climate extremes at national scale, consequently addressing its growing demand among public and private institutions. Further research, into the complex interactions of cumulative climatic factors and external components like ecological systems and anthropogenic biomes will go a long way in boosting climate information.

The impact of multipath is characterized in the context of a given environment and application. In Malawi, Zomba geodynamics Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) is in a multipath prone environment. The GNSS observations for this station have been used in geodynamics studies in Malawi without an understanding of multipath affecting the positioning accuracy. Taking this as an advantage, this paper evaluated pseudorange multipath (MP) and signal noise ratio (SNR) on both L1 (MP1 and SNR1) and L2 (MP2 and SNR2) for the station. This was specifically addressed by computing the elevation mask with minimum and maximum multipath effects. In addition, the number of satellite vehicles (SVs) and their associated Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) are also determined to define their relationship with respect to elevation angles. One week GNSS observations spanning a twenty-four hour interval for DOY 001 to DOY 007 in January 2018 were analysed in Translation Editing and Quality Check (TEQC)  software at four (10º, 15º,  20º and 25º) cut-off angles.  Results indicate high multipath effects for both MP1 and MP2 at 10º elevation mask among the four elevation masks. The least MP1 and MP2 multipath effects were detected at an elevation angle of 25º. In addition, MP1 multipath was worse than MP2 all the angles. Moreover, statistical results demonstrated an increase in both SNR1 and SNR2 with respect to elevation angle. For these days, L2 signal was more affected by noise than L1. Further to this, an assessment of SVs and GDOP for the CORS show that at least ten (10) satellites were observed in each day 10º and 15º elevation cut-off. The number of satellites dropped to five (5) at the elevation angle of 25º resulting into a larger GDOP value of 4.5 (a decrease by about 38% from 1.7 at 10º and 15º elevation cut-off angles). Therefore, to increase both the number of satellites and precision, Zomba CORS may be upgraded to a multi-constellation CORS by including other navigation systems such as GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou. While it is possible to reject GNSS satellite observations below the horizon, it is recommended that post-processing of GNSS data for Zomba geodynamics GNSS be done at elevation masks above 15º. Considering that multipath repeats itself every sidereal day, it is thus recommended to model or remove multipath affecting Zomba geodynamics CORS. In addition, the study also recommends that trees very close to Zomba CORS antenna be removed to reduce signal scattering.", "Vol": "Vol 10, No1", "Year": 2021, "Link to Journal": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/730/401", "Comment": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 34.301525, -13.254308 ] } },

The results show that the post-monsoon season indicates the best correlation (0.59), followed by the monsoon (0.56), pre-monsoon (0.47), and winter (0.44) season. The water bodies reflect a strongly positive correlation in all the four seasons (0.65 in pre-monsoon, 0.51 in monsoon, 0.53 in post-monsoon, and 0.62 in winter). On green vegetation, this correlation is also strongly positive in monsoon (0.57), post-monsoon (0.62), and winter (0.55), whereas it is moderate positive in pre-monsoon (0.37) season. The built-up area and bare land build a moderate positive correlation in all the four seasons (0.35 in pre-monsoon, 0.43 in monsoon, 0.48 in post-monsoon, and 0.39 in winter). Among the four seasons, the post-monsoon season builds the best correlation for all LULC types, whereas the pre-monsoon season has the least correlation.

While LULC monitoring and classification has been undertaken in Eswatini, little attention has been given to ascertaining covered thematic areas, methods of image classification, and approaches and techniques for improving classification accuracy. This paper summarises and synthesizes the progress made in the Kingdom of Eswatini regarding the application of remote sensing and GIS in LULC monitoring and classification. Eight thematic areas (water resources mapping; land degradation; forestry; urban expansion; crop production; wildfire detection; disease surveillance; general mapping) dominate evaluated LULC studies, employing three LULC classification methods (classic; manual; advanced). While some studies include strengths and weaknesses of LULC classification techniques applied, others do not. This review shows that only two advanced classifiers (random forest; object-based) were identified from the reviewed articles. In addition, reviewed studies applied only two approaches (use of multi temporal data; fine spatial resolution data) and three techniques (use of ancillary data; post-classification procedure; the use of multisource data) for improving classification accuracy. Furthermore, the review finds that limited LULC investigations have been covered in Eswatini with a specific focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As such, this review recommends the 1) adaptation of strengths and weaknesses for any image classification technique employed in future publication, 2) the application of advanced image classifiers, 3) the use of more varied approaches and techniques for improving classification accuracy and area estimate, 4) inclusion of standard errors or confidence intervals for error-adjusted area estimates as part of accuracy assessment reporting, and 5) the application of Earth Observation (EO) data in the production of information for the support of the SDGs.", "Vol": "Vol 10, No2", "Year": 2021, "Link to Journal": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/907/412", "Comment": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 31.465866, -26.522503 ] } },

While conventional foliar analytical methods provide accurate results, they are not time and cost-effective in a high productivity environment. This study aims to test the capability of remote sensing to detect macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies rapidly in juvenile trees. We acquired full-waveform hyperspectral data (350-2500nm) from 135 young trees planted in individual pots in a controlled forestry nursery environment. We tested remote sensing capabilities of detecting nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and boron (B) which is usually measured in young commercially planted forest varieties when assessing the nutritional status of plant hybrids. The robustness of the random forest algorithm significantly reduced noise in the dataset, whilst producing promising results for certain macronutrients such as P and N (0.95 and 0.89, respectively) and micronutrients such as Mn and Cu (0.90 and 0.86, respectively). This study identified the most critical wavebands for detecting nutrient deficiencies using built-in random forest (RF) measures of variable importance. We recommend testing the use of strategic portions of the electromagnetic spectrum for reducing noise and enabling faster computing time, such as portable near-infrared technology.", "Vol": "Vol 10, No2", "Year": 2021, "Link to Journal": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/908/413", "Comment": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 30.3794118, -29.6006068 ] } },

The Mann-Kendall and Spearman correlation statistical tests were used on the time series to observe trends and correlations between the NDVI and the NDWI datasets. The Spearman correlation test results showed that there were high correlations between the NDVI and the NDWI datasets (all above 0.805). Furthermore, the Man-Kendall test showed that all the datasets had positively increasing trends, while the NDVI datasets all had monotonic positive trends. Large differences in the NDVI and the NDWI were seen for the different vegetation types during times of drought, and farmland was the most severely affected with an average of 19% decrease in the NDVI and an average of 71% decrease in the NDWI.", "Vol": "Vol 10, No2", "Year": 2021, "Link to Journal": "http://www.sajg.org.za/index.php/sajg/article/view/911/414", "Comment": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 26.6772325, -33.6781138 ] } }
